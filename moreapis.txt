SOCCER DATA APIs (FREE / FREE-TIER) — VERIFIED & LAYOUTS
Date verified: 2026-02-16 (America/Toronto)

How to read this file:
- “Public (no key)” = can be called immediately (still respect rate limits / fair use).
- “Key required” = free tier exists but requires an API key/token.
- “Layout” = base URL + endpoint patterns + example requests.
- “What you can get” = practical feature list for soccer (H2H, stats, injuries, lineups, etc).

# ========================================================
SECTION 1) PUBLIC (NO KEY) — WORKING OPTIONS

1. Fantasy Premier League (FPL) “unofficial official” endpoints (Premier League only)
   Status: PUBLIC (no key) — reachable
   Best for: injuries/availability flags (PL), fixtures, teams, players, live GW stats, some lineup-ish info via minutes/starts
   Not for: other leagues, official starting XI before kickoff (it’s more fantasy-centric)

Base URL:

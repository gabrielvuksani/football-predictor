1) Time-decayed form / strength
- EWMA time-decayed statistics (points, goals for/against, shots/xG if available).
  Formula: s_t = α x_t + (1-α) s_{t-1}, with α = 1 - exp(-Δt/τ).
  Do home/away splits.
- Opponent-adjusted form: weight match contributions by opponent strength (Elo/table).
- Schedule difficulty: rolling average opponent strength.
- Rest/congestion: days since last match; matches in last 7/14/30 days; “3rd match in 7 days” flag.

2) Stabilize noisy rates (Empirical Bayes shrinkage)
- For any rate p = successes/n (win%, clean sheets, BTTS, over/under):
  Beta-Binomial shrinkage: p_hat = (w + a)/(n + a + b)
  Choose a,b from league-wide prior or fixed reasonable prior.
- Use separate priors per league/season stage.

3) Goal modeling (Poisson → upgrades)
- Attack/defense model: estimate λ_home, λ_away using rolling attack/defense strengths + home advantage.
- Add correlation adjustment (Dixon–Coles style) for low-score dependence (0–0, 1–0, 0–1).
- Use Skellam distribution for goal difference features from λ_home, λ_away.
- Monte Carlo simulation: draw scorelines many times to derive W/D/L, BTTS, O/U probabilities.

4) Odds / market math (if odds exist)
- Convert odds to implied probabilities: q_i = 1/odds_i
- Remove margin (overround): p_i = q_i / Σ q_j
- Work in log-odds: logit(p)=ln(p/(1-p))
- Market-vs-model delta: Δ_i = logit(p_model_i) - logit(p_market_i)
- Entropy/confidence: H(p) = -Σ p_i ln p_i
- If multiple books: average in logit space or use median; compute dispersion as uncertainty.

5) Council / ensemble math (expert disagreement + reliability)
- Disagreement: variance across experts per outcome Var(p_e(outcome))
- Pairwise deltas between experts; max-min spread; entropy of ensemble.
- KL divergence expert→ensemble: D_KL(p^e || p^ens)
- Dynamic expert weighting by recent proper loss:
  w_e ∝ exp(-η * L_e), where L_e is rolling log loss or Brier.
  Do this per league and with time decay.
- Meta-learner inputs: include raw probs + logits + entropy + disagreement metrics + recency and league id.

6) Calibration + evaluation (so probabilities mean something)
- Use proper scoring rules: log loss and Brier score, tracked by league and time window.
- Calibration curves by confidence buckets; reliability diagrams.
- Post-hoc calibration options: isotonic regression / Platt scaling.
- Add calibration features: “expected calibration error” proxy per league as a conditioning signal.
- Use walk-forward (rolling window) backtests; forbid leakage by ensuring features only use data available pre-match.

7) Injuries / lineups / rotation math (if available)
- Availability index: sum over unavailable players of (minutes_share * importance_weight).
- Lineup stability: Jaccard overlap J = |S_t ∩ S_{t-1}| / |S_t ∪ S_{t-1}|.
- Rotation intensity: 1 - J (or starters changed count).
- Fatigue proxy: team minutes load rolling sum if minutes are available; otherwise use congestion proxies.

8) News math (if news volume exists)
- News volume spike z-score: z_t = (m_t - μ)/σ over a baseline window.
- Recency decay on z_t via EWMA.
- Simple topic buckets (injury/coach/discipline/transfer) if headlines can be classified; use counts per bucket.

9) Derived “match context” interactions (often high-signal)
- Strength difference features: Elo_diff, form_diff, xG_diff, injury_diff, rest_diff.
- Nonlinear transforms: tanh(Elo_diff/k), log(1+|diff|), piecewise bins.
- Season stage: normalized matchweek; interactions with pressure bands (relegation/Europe).
